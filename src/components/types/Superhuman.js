      <h2>general tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Imposter workaholics are actually addicted to the validation that comes from working, not to the work
            itself. Start training yourself to veer away from external validation. No one should have more power
            to make you feel good about yourself than you–-even your boss when they give your project the stamp
            of approval.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the flip side, learn to take constructive criticism at face value, not personally.
          </li>
          <li>
            As you become more attuned to internal validation and able to nurture your inner confidence, affirming that
            you are competent and skilled. You'll be able to ease off the gas as you gauge how much work is healthy and rewarding.

          "I have spent my years since Princeton, while at law school and in my various professional jobs, not 
          feeling completely a part of the worlds I inhabit. I am always looking over my shoulder wondering if
          I measure up."
