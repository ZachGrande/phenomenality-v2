        <p>
          The soloist represents a person with imposter phenomenon that has 
          difficulty asking others for help. Perhaps they may feel that others 
          are not as competent as themselves or that they must prove their own 
          worth through their individual productivity.

      <h2>general tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep in mind that you could be taking much longer to complete something by 
            insisting that you have to figure it out yourself rather than reaching out to someone.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's important to recognize that no one is completely isolated. Independence is blissful; however, it shouldn't deter you from accepting
            assistance from others. Everyone has their areas of strength, and asking 
            for help with a particular area you are not good at will help to maximize
            both the quality and quantity of your completed tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Therefore, you should learn to view asking questions as a willingness
            to learn rather than incompetence.

      <h2>quotes</h2>
      <blockquote>
          "I still sometimes feel like a loser kid in high school. I
          just have to pick myself up and tell myself that I'm a superstar
          every morning so that I can get through this day and be for my
          fans what they need for me to be."
