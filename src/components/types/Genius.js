          “The natural genius represents a person with imposter phenomenon 
          that not only struggles with perfectionism but also sets out 
          to achieve lofty goals on their first try. These individuals 
          feel unworthy and shameful if they cannot easily 
          complete a task or achieve a goal on their first go.

      <h2>general tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To move past this, try viewing yourself as a work in progress. 
            Accomplishing great things continuous learning, growing, and making mistakes--for everyone, even the most confident people. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Rather than beating yourself up when you don't reach your impossibly
            high standards, identify specific, small, and changeable behaviors that you can improve over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, if you want to have more impact at the office, 
            it's much more productive to focus on going out of your comfort zone to practice your presentation 
            skills than swearing off speaking up in meetings as something you're “just not good at.”
